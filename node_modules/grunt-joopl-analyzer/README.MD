### Change log

### 1.1.2

Increases joopl-analyzer module version dependency to 1.1.2

### 1.1.0

Full compatibility with latest version of joopl-analyzer package. Now analyzer supports including other moduleinfo.js from other analysis. This enables different frameworks to reference and automatically include third-party dependencies! Documentation will be updated soon to reflect this new feature.

### 1.0.2
Full compatibility with the latest version of joopl-analyzer package, which makes "joopl-analyzer.json" file obsolete and unifies configuration in a single place (using command-line arguments for all parameters).

GruntJS task has been modified in order to fully-support these changes:

- Now all configuration is made within the `Gruntfile.js` file.
- Now this task supports multi-targeting options, and all options that were present in the `joopl-analyzer.json` file are configurable as options of any GruntJS target.

### 1.0.1

- Removes `watch` support, since this should be achieved using a *watching* Grunt task like `grunt-contrib-watch`.

#### 1.0.0

First release
