# Welcome to jOOPL Analyzer !

- [See version changelog](#changelog)

## Introduction

First of all, thank you for your interest on jOOPL and this analyzer tool.

If you're not familiar with jOOPL, jOOPL stands for "JavaScript Object-Oriented Programming Library"
and jOOPL Analyzer is a very powerful tool which analyzes your existing jOOPL-based JavaScript code
and generates a file called "moduleinfo.js".

That "moduleinfo.js" file will contain some kind of metadata that will let jOOPL load the required 
source files to the Web browser to work with some given class or a group of classes.

[Follow this link to learn more and get great documentation about both jOOPL and jOOPL Analyzer](http://mfidemraizer.github.io/joopl/classes/joopl-analyzer.html)

## Basic usage how-to

jOOPL analyzer should be installed globally using npm:

	npm -g install joopl-analyzer

Once it's installed, it can be executed globally in your shell environment.

`joopl-analyzer` command will analyze your JavaScript code starting from a base directory. If no base directory is provided,
the analyzer will start from current directory in your shell session. 

A concrete base directory will be provided calling the command this way:

	joopl-analyzer --directory ./src
	joopl-analyzer --directory c:\myproject

Bugfix: Problems when detecting instances class members in class hierarchies.

<h3 id="v1_1_0">1.1.0</h3>
- Include support. Now analyzer supports including other moduleinfo.js from other analysis. This enables different frameworks to reference and automatically include third-party dependencies! Documentation will be updated soon to reflect this new feature.

<h3 id="v1_0_5">1.0.5</h3>
#### Features
- Now all parameters must be passed to the command-line using CLI arguments and "joopl-analyzer.json" configuration file gets absolutely deprectated.


<h3 id="v1_0_4">1.0.4</h3>

- In some cases, new instances weren't detected. It was an error executing some regular expression. Now this has been fixed.

<h3 id="v1_0_3">1.0.3</h3>
#### Bugfixes:
- Previous version introduced a bug: classes deriving built-in jOOPL classes produced an error during detection.

#### Bugfixes:
- Dependencies in few cases weren't detected in the right order in very few cases.

<h3 id="v1_0_1">1.0.1</h3> 
#### Bugfixes:
- Dependencies from more than a class hierarchy level were not detected.
- New class instances from non-imported namespaces were parsed and this situation caused output errors. Now these are not parsed anymore as expected.

First public release.
