# Welcome to jOOPL Analyzer !

## Introduction

First of all, thank you for your interest on jOOPL and this analyzer tool.

If you're not familiar with jOOPL, jOOPL stands for "JavaScript Object-Oriented Programming Library"
and jOOPL Analyzer is a very powerful tool which analyzes your existing jOOPL-based JavaScript code
and generates a file called "moduleinfo.js".

That "moduleinfo.js" file will contain some kind of metadata that will let jOOPL load the required 
source files to the Web browser to work with some given class or a group of classes.

[Follow this link to learn more and get great documentation about both jOOPL and jOOPL Analyzer](http://mfidemraizer.github.io/joopl/classes/joopl-analyzer.html)

## Basic usage how-to

jOOPL analyzer should be installed globally using npm:

	npm -g install joopl-analyzer

Once it's installed, it can be executed globally in your shell environment.

`joopl-analyzer` command will analyze your JavaScript code starting from a base directory. If no base directory is provided,
the analyzer will start from current directory in your shell session. 

A concrete base directory will be provided calling the command this way:

	joopl-analyzer --directory ./src
	joopl-analyzer --directory c:\myproject
